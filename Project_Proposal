**Story Pitch**


A story that we thought would be interesting is crime comparisons from 2019 to 2020 between Seattle/areas of Seattle and surrounding cities in King County. The timeframe coincides with COVID-19, which severely impacted the lives of everyone on Earth. We have two ideas that we would like to answer with our given datasets. 
One idea is that crimes went down during COVID because everyone was forced to be inside. The other idea is that we believe that there may have been a spike in specific crimes such as robbery and theft because people lost their jobs and had no other means of survival. I think exploring this topic will provide the public with data that can be used to compare the effects covid had on the crime rate here in Seattle.
Exploring this topic with our datasets will provide insights into crime comparisons between Seattle and similar areas, coinciding with COVID. With our datasets, we will answer the general ideas of whether crimes went up or down for Seattle and surrounding cities, and we can dive deep into more specific questions. Examples of that would be which types of crime went up and down, and which specific neighborhoods in Seattle and King County had the greatest increases/decreases.
We can also take a look at how socioeconomic factors come into play in these areas to better understand shifts in crime. I was thinking about creating some infographics to help visualize differences in demographics. Maybe we can even use these datasets to predict similar increases in crime if a pandemic or similar event happens in the future, and maybe the datasets will help give insight regarding the pandemic to our local areas. There’s lots of possibilities we can have to help explore our general idea of whether crime increased or decreased in Seattle, and in surrounding King County cities.
Our data is taken from two sources that tracked similar crimes. There are lots of different categories for crimes such as assault, theft, property crime, drug crime, and driving under the influence. One of our sources is from the King County Sheriff’s Department. The other is from Seattle Open Data.
Finding Data
Our two data sources are (https://data.kingcounty.gov/Law-Enforcement-Safety/KCSO-Incident-Dataset-Historic-to-2019/rzfs-wyvy) and (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-Offense-Type-by-Neighborhood/89ny-gtxr).  The data for the first source was community created based off documentation by the Seattle Police Department. The data for the second source was collected by the King County Sheriff’s Department.
King County Data: Rows 20.4k Columns 13
Seattle Open Data: Rows 10.4k Columns 17
Background Research and Inspiration 
Other sources we considered/used for inspiration were (https://data.seattle.gov/Public-Safety/SPD-Crime-Data-2008-Present/tazs-3rd5), (https://www.fbi.gov/how-we-can-help-you/more-fbi-services-and-information/ucr/nibrs), (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/seattlecitywashington/), (https://kingcounty.gov/depts/executive/performance-strategy-budget/regional-planning/Demographics.aspx), and (https://counciloncj.org/impact-report-covid-19-and-crime/). We want to compare these two data sets and see if there are any differences as well as answer questions about the data. Like why the percentage of certain crimes when down and others went up. 
-	Demographic data implications for increase/decreases in crime
-	COVID impacts with crime more generally
